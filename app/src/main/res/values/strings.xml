    <string name="create_club_text">Learningx allows individuals to create and manage their own club or organization. It may be offered by a college, community center, or other organization as a way to provide opportunities for people to come together and pursue shared interests or goals. The specifics of the program may vary, but generally it involves providing resources and support to help individuals plan, promote, and run their own clubs. This may include things like access to meeting spaces, funding or grants, and guidance on how to effectively lead and manage a club. The goal of "Create Your Club" is to empower individuals to take the lead in creating and shaping their own extracurricular activities and to build a sense of community and belonging.</string>
